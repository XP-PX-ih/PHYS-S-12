					<p>The laser cutter works by focusing a laser onto a point and then burning away the material placed underneath it. In order to activate the machine, you must first activate the ventilation, then open the air vent behind the laser cutter, and finally turn it on. Before operating it, you must set the laser to the appropriate height, or z-focus, using the little measuring assitant. You place it on top of your material and match the rectangular part of the laser to the notch on the cylinder. Setting the correct z-focus is essential for optimal laser cutting, as it focuses the laser at the correct point. Then you can import your .DXF file into Rhino, delete any construction lines, and then print it to UCP. Once within UCP, you need to ensure that the settings match your material and its thickness. Otherwise the laser may not cut as intended, which in some cases can lead to a blaze. If the settings match, then you are free to drag your design through UCP to place it in any spot you want on the material. It also has a handy tool that allows you to move the laser cutter to an exact point to see if your design fits in that spot. You can get within a milimeter if you really want. If everything is correct, you can then start the laser cutter, but you must remain at the machine for the whole duration of cutting to catch any malfunctions or unintended problems. In case of a fire, an oven mit and a fire blanket are located to the left of the laser cutter to smother any blazes.</p>

				<td style="width: 50%; padding-left: 1%; vertical-align: top">
					<p>The vinyl cutter works by dragging a blade across vinyl or similar materials and rolling the material through. It's good for creating stickers and flexible circuits. To cut out something onto a sheet of vinyl, you load it in through the back and select <i>Piece</i> on the machine. It then automatically measures it and, if using Inkscape, it creates the plane on which you can work. You can then upload decals or images to Inkscape, set them as trace, and then print through the vinyl cutter. If you want it to be a sticker, you then grab some of the sticky paper, place it on top, and then peel off your sticker to then place on another object. The main safety procedure with the vinyl cutter is to keep your hand out of the machine, that way the blade does not create a cool blood design on your flesh.</p>

		<h2>Useless Cardboard Box</h2>
		<p>Once again in Fusion360, we began work on modeling a useless cardboard box. [Include a video example]. We started with a provided model from Nathan. We then put in sketches using center rectangles, midpoint constraints, and guidelines (construction lines) and turned them into holes using the extrude tool.</p>
		<br>
		<img style="width: 100%" src="./Images/Screenshot (1).png" alt="Honey, where is my box?"</img>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>We then unfolded the box in Fusion and learned how to project it to the sketch, allowing us to see the "shadows" of the 3D objects on the 2D plane. We then exported the projected sketch as a .DXF file so that we can send it to the laser cutter.</p>

		<h2>Cardboard Container</h2>
		<p>We started work on Fusion360. I learned how to create a sketch and use the rectangle, circle, line, select, offset, mirror, and rectangular pattern tools. I also managed to somehow reverse my zoom in and zoom out which is quite annoying. I deleted my original file of the box as it was massive, though in hindsight I realize I could have simply adjusted the parameters. For my new design, I decided that I should make my box into a house for no particular reason. Then I found out it's too big. I then decided to opt for a simple box but with engravings to customize it. I spent 40 minutes adding engravings. At least 20 of those minutes were spent making the Roblox Man Face.</p>

		<img style="width: 100%" src="./Images/Screenshot (3).png" alt="MAN FACE NOOOOOOO"</img>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>The engravings were lighter than I expected, so I'll have to increase line width next time. Otherwise, everything printed well without any fires. I had to hot glue the corners though because it did not hold itself together for more than half a second.</p>
