		<h2>Cardboard Container</h2>
		<p>Nathan taught us how to create a sketch and use the rectangle, circle, line, select, offset, mirror, and rectangular pattern tools in Fusion 360 to create a simple box with "fingers" or "teeth" that would allow it to hold itself together when folded. I taught myself how to reverse my zoom in and zoom out directions, and then immediately forgot how I did it. I deleted the original file of the box that we made with Nathan as I had made mine massive, though in hindsight I realize I could have simply adjusted the parameters. I had a few ideas of creativity for my box design, the main one being a basic house shape. However, I realized it would be too big so I decided to just engrave onto the box. I spent 40 minutes adding engravings. At least 20 of those minutes were spent making the Roblox Man Face.</p>

				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		
		<p>After laser cutting, I realized that the fingers did not mesh together well as I did not account for laser kerf. Additionally, the engravings were too light. I had to hot glue the box together.</p>

		<p>Although the box was sufficient, I was not happy with just a basic box. I wanted to do something more complex. With some input from a friend, Viraj, I decided to try and make a hemisphere box. My first plan to do this was through a pattern that would allow the cardboard to bend in multiple directions so I could fold it up into a hemisphere. However, I quickly realized that my idea did not work as: one, it did not do that; and two, you cannot simply raise the outer circle to make the hemisphere without adding more material.</p>

		<table style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto">
			<tr>

				</td>
				<td>
					<img style="width: 100%" src="./Module_02 Images/Circle_1_Fold.jpeg" alt="a failed attempt"</img>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<p>I started planning on how I was supposed to make a hemisphere out of two dimensional parts. I then remembered magnets I used to play with when I was younger - though I sometimes still play with them - and how they had an instruction on how to make a sphere out of the square magnets and the triangle ones. You can see my recollection in the bottom right of the image below. I decided I would try this with cardboard.</p>

		<div style="text-align: center">
			<img style="width: 50%" src="./Module_02 Images/Circle_Redesign.jpeg" alt="Paper Towel + Pen"</img>
		</div>
		<br>

		<p>I scaled the model down a lot so I did not waste as much cardboard on my prototype. The design came out really well, with the only problem being small gaps between the triangles and squares because I did not account for laser kerf.</p>
		<br>
		<table style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto">

				</td>
				<td>
					<img style="width: 100%;" src="./Module_02 Images/Circle_2_Prototype.jpeg" alt="Beyblade"</img>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		
		<p>I then added an offset to account for laser kerf and then scaled up the model for the final construction. Unfortunately, it was smaller than I intended, so I decided to hot glue one side to make sure that the offset was good.</p>
		<br>
		<table style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto">

				</td>
				<td>
					<img style="width: 100%" src="./Module_02 Images/Circle_2_Kerf.jpeg" alt="lots of burn marks"</img>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		
		<p>I scaled up the model again and then fully assembled it. Overall, I am quite happy with how it turned out. However, I will need to take more caution when using hot glue as I managed to burn myself on the glue three times on the same finger. I also need to work over a smaller area when using hot glue, as I tried gluing across large sections within the hemisphere and that resulted in me having to redo glueing because it dried too quickly.</p>

		<h2>Modeling Household/Lab Objects</u></h2>
		<p>Before trying to model two objects from the lab, I watched a <a style="color: #000000" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0TYcB-2_8o"><u>Fusion 360 tutorial</u></a> from SourceCAD. I found it very helpful and have learned most of the basics. For my two objects, I decided to model a Time of Flight Proximity Sensor because I may use it in one of my <a style="color: #000000" href="module_01.html"><u>final projects</u></a>, and I then decided to model a small clamp because it was a simple shape that had curves. The sensor was relatively simple, only requiring simple squares and circles and the extrude tool. However, it required a lot of time trying to measure the components as most of them were 5mm or less. The sensor consists of the main body (circuit board) and additional bodies that are the extra components on top or underneath the board.The clamp was more complex than the sensor, requiring tools like sweep and offset planes, but it was quite satisfying to see the final result. The clamp taught me that I need to work on modeling curvature. Each handle is a different body, as well as the rubber bits at the ends. The screw head, nut, and spring are also separate bodies.</p>
