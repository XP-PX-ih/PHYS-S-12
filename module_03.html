					<p>For my kinetic sculpture, I decided to recreate a scene from the Death Note opening. My original idea was to make a loop that they followed, speeding up towards the middle and slowing down as they got further out, similar to planetary orbits. However, I struggled to find a feasable way do it without controller programming, so I opted for having them get closer to the artificial ground towards the middle and then raise back up as they got further out.</p>

		<p>The way the mechanism works is by having a single motor power both the vertical and rotational motion through vertical and horizontal gears. The rotational motion is created through gears and a belt. The vertical motion is created through gears and <a style="color: #000000" href="https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/intro-dig-fab/03_tools/index.html"><u>crank sliders.</u></a> In order to keep the belt in place while also allowing it to move, I had the idea to make a telescopic support beam. I got the idea from telescopic toys and things I had messed with before. The hardest part of the design was finding a way to allow the motor to power the horizontal motion while the belt was shifting up and down. My solution was to create a compressible chain of gears. The idea is to allow the center gear to move freely while also connecting the other two gears. This, in theory, should allow it to move to the side, decreasing the height of the gear chain, while still allowing the gears to move effectively.</p>

		<br>
		<p>The next aspect of the design I had to figure out was how to design the gears. Using this <a style="color: #000000" href="https://www.instructables.com/How-to-make-gears-easily/"><u>resource,</u></a> I figured out how many big each tooth would have to be to make X amount of teeth.
		</p>
		<p>Here's the equation:</p>
		<code style="border: 1px solid #29353C; border-radius: 2px; background-color: #E6E6E6; font-size: 120%">
			(2*teeth_amount)*tooth_width = reference_circle_circumferance
		</code>			
		<br>
		<p>I went for 17 teeth because I had read somewhere that 17 was the standard minimum. Using the polygon and circular pattern tools, I was able to make the gear. Something I'm very proud and happy about is that I managed to make the sketch parametric, so I can perfectly scale up the gear simply by adjusting the reference circle's diamter.</p>

		<p>The first part of the kinetic sculpture that I wanted to test was the compressible gear chain. I believe this to be the most complex part of the sculpture, so I wanted to make sure it would function first before everything else. I printed the chain of three at a reduced size for testing and then put them together. The gears seemed to work, though I'll need to add an offset next time and double up on the connecting piece. I tried using a motor, but I ran out of time to properly connect it. However, it did reveal the speed at which the gears would spin: too fast.</p>

		<p>I redid my initial sketch of the design as I realized there were parts that did not quite work, such as the single support beam placement. I made a more detailed sketch of all the components in Microsoft Paint. Noticeable Changes: two telescopic support beams instead of one, a wall that helps guide the "compressible" gears, gear ratios, a worm gear, and ball bearings.</p>

		</div>
		<p>After creating the sketch, I began making sketches of each component in Fusion 360. It took more time than I had hoped, with me spending roughly three hours to complete all the sketches. I got rid of the worm gear in hopes that the vertical and horizontal gears could still move each other. I also changed the amount of teeth per gear: smallest (motor gear) has seven teeth, the "compressible" gears and the height gears have 14, and the belt gear has 28. I did this to slow down the belt, but also to try and get the vertical motion to sync with the horizontal motion - going down in the middle and up at the ends. For the telescopic supports, I added "fingers" to make it easier on myself when assembling. I made to sure to add an offset to everything that would be significantly affected by laser kurf.</p>

		<p>Since the line for the laser cutter was so long, I decided to spend my time trying to make the characters from the scene: Light and L. I first tried using the laser cutter, but I continued to mess it up and realized it was because I did not import a completely black image. I tried filling it in manually, but that still did not work. I decided to switch to laser engravings as that would allow me to add details to the characters. Using a 3D square and the canvas tool, I imported images of the characters and then traced them using the line and spline tools. The spline tool is now my new best friend for art.</p>

				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>Now I actually got most of these printed before drawing L and Light, but I still needed everything cut and the documentation will flow better with this here. The offset seemed to have worked really well - I went for an offset of 0.2 instead of 0.3, learning from the box - and all that was left was to assemble it.</p>

		</div>
		<p>The part that worked the best was the box for the telescopic supports. The teeth fit beautifully. Unfortunately, I quickly realized I did not account for the thickness of the cardboard in all areas that I should have. This resulted in some oversized and undersized parts. I was able to fix the telescopic supports simply by cutting off excess material, but undersized items were difficult. I expanded and reprinted the bottom of the smooth belt gear, which worked well. However, I messed up my calculations for the belt length multiple times, resulting in my sculpture completely lacking a necessary part. Additionally, the "compressible" gears did not move correctly and often jammed during transition. I upped the power on engravings for the characters a little too high as well, which left some marks; however, I decided to not recut them as the other parts of the sculpture were more important to focus on. Now interestingly, while cutting some of the parts, a small fire actually started in the laser cutter and burned a miniscal part of one of the levers. I found this really weird because the levers were a seemingly sufficient distance apart. I'll need to make sure I space parts that get cut side to side further apart from each other. </p>

		<p>I decided to give in and implement two motors into the sculpture. I printed another motor gear and telescopic support and, reusing old material, added a horizontal support to keep the motor level with the gears. The way I fastened most things together was through hot glue, although for the moving levers connected to the height gears I used M3 x 20 screws and a nuts.</p>

		</div>
		<p>Unfortunately, I did not have enough time to fully complete the kinetic sculpture without putting my other assignment at risk. To adapt, I used a variety of my unused materials as supports for the sculpture. Putting the motor against the different gears, you can see that it mostly works, other than the height gears. If I had more time, I would have made the minor tweaks necessary to allow for both movements to be performed simultaneously and allow the height gears to have more torque for moving the heavy belt. It also needed more structural support and adjustements on the gears themselves, as they sometimes would slip.
