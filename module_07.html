Documentation Rambling:
For my minimal viable product, I switched from the XIAO ESP32C3 to the ESP32 DevBoard because my final project requires more pins than the XIAO has. Switching now would give me time to aquaint myself with the different microcontroller. I figured the hardest part of my final project involved connecting the optical sensor to the microcontroller and having the inputs on the ESP32 output onto the computer themself rather than the serial monitor. After some research, I found that bluetooth will be easier than a USB connection because the ESP32-WROOM-32 does not have USB HID capabilities.

Bluetooth ESP32 Keyboard: https://github.com/T-vK/ESP32-BLE-Keyboard
The bluetooth keyboard library did not work initially. I had to enter the .cpp file itself and edit the code to include ".c_str()" on all the std::string functions. Thankfully there were only two of them. I added a few lines of code to my previous keyboard code and it worked wonderfully.

Bluetooth ESP32 Mouse: https://github.com/T-vK/ESP32-BLE-Mouse
Had the exact same problem with strings as the keyboard. To simplify the example test, I turned it into an autoclicker. It did not work. After a lot of trials, I found that it worked on everyone's device but mine. I deleted some COM ports that were being taken up by other bluetooth devices and that seemed to fix the problem.

I then implemented both libraries into my keyboard code to test simultaneous usage. My initial setup did not work: it resulted in neither mouse nor keyboard outputs.

https://github.com/Georgegipa/ESP32-BLE-Combo
I switched to a fork of the two libraries. Fromt the Arduino skethes, it appeared to be the exact same, so I assumed the differences were in the library's code. To ensure no malfunctions, I delted the old libraries and just kept the combo. I created a short code to test the functions.
[Insert Experiment Sketch]
It had the same string problem as all the others. While working on the code, I found that there existed different outputs for the keyboard: "Keyboard.write" was for a single character or specific button, "Keyboard.press" was for built in keyboard keys, and "Keyboard.print" was for strings of characters. The library worked well, so now all I had left to do was implement it into my code and calibrate the timings.
